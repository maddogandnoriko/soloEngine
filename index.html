<p><b>Create Your Hero</b><br>
   Roll 3d6 once each for <b>BODY</b> (physical prowess & health), <b>AGILE</b> (reflexes & quickness), <b>MIND</b> (mental capacity & intelligence), <b>SPIRIT</b> (spunk & willpower). The lowest of the three dice is that ability‚Äôs score. For Hit Points roll 1d8. Heroes begin with one clich√©, roll 2d6, and gain one clich√© for each roll over 3. If you wish, determine a past, looks, quirks, etc. Be creative and stuff. Heroes start with a light weapon(d6 damage) and leather armor(AC 12).</p>
<p><b>Determine Goals & The First Scene</b><br>
  Figure out why your character is there and where they are in their story. This is a short description of where our hero is and what's happening. Imagine a starting point for your adventure. <i>Are you stealing space station plans? Are you plundering a tomb?</i></p>
<p><b>Advantage & Disadvantage</b><br>
            When you roll dice and the hero has an applicable clich√©, advantage, trait etc., roll an extra die and pick the best result. If the character has a significant disadvantage,  pick the worst result. This applies to almost ALL rolls, including combat and ability checks. Characters can only gain 1 extra die per roll.</p>
<p><b>Begin Asking Questions</b><br>
            To begin play, ask a question that has a <b>Yes</b>‚Äã or <b>No</b> answer, it is important to keep it simple. <i>Are guards present? Do I encounter a trap?</i> For each question, if the result is <i>Even Odds</i> roll 1d6, if the result is <i>Likely</i> or <i>Unlikely</i> roll 2d6, if the result is <i>Very Likely</i> or <i>Very Unlikely</i> roll 3d6 and choose the best/worst result as appropriate and consult the table below.<br>
            1- No, And&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4-Yes, But<br>
            2- No&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5-Yes<br>
            3- No, But&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6-Yes, And<br>
            <br>
            <b><i>"And"</i></b> means even better/worse than you expected.<br>
            <b><i>"But"</i></b> means there is a limited effect or a drawback.</p>
<p><b>Twist</b><br>
            Roll a d6. This is the Twist Die. If it comes up a 1, there is a twist to the scene.<br>
            <br>
            Roll a d6 to get the Twist Noun:<br>
            1- NPC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2- PC<br>
            3- Organization&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4- Physical event<br>
            5- Emotional event&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6- Item<br>
            <br>
            Roll another d6 to get the Twist Action:<br>
            1- Appears&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2- Alters the location<br>
            3- Helps the hero&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4- Hinders the hero<br>
            5- Changes the goal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6- Ends the scene<br>
            <br>
            Put the Twist Noun and Twist Action together to get a two-word sentence. What this means is up to you based on the goings on.</p>
<p><b>Ability Checks</b><br>
If a character attempts something where the outcome is uncertain and failure is possible, they make an Ability Check(Check).<br>
<br>
Roll a d20 and add the relevant ability score. If the total is greater than 15, the character succeeds. If not, they fail.</p>
<p><b>Opposed Checks</b><br>
If a Check is opposed by another character, then instead of aiming to exceed 15, you must exceed the opposing character‚Äôs relevant ability score +10 in order to succeed.</p>
<p><b>Resolving Combat</b><br>
To make an attack, roll a d20 and add the character‚Äôs <b>BODY</b>(melee) or <b>MIND</b>(ranged) score. If the Attack Roll total is greater than the defender‚Äôs Armor Class, the attack hits. If not, the attack misses. <i>Monsters usually don't have ability scores, add their HD to rolls instead.</i></p>
<p>
  <b>Taking & Causing Damage</b><br>
ALL Damage Rolls (traps, monsters, falling debris, random injuries, etc.) are modified. If a Damage Roll includes more than one die, do not add them together, modify each die face, then add them.<br>
<br>
<b>Roll&nbsp;Damage</b><br>
1	0 HP<br>
2-5	1 HP<br>
6-9	2 HP<br>
10+	4 HP<br>
<br>
Any modifiers to damage are all applied to any one die in the Damage Roll. Example A PC wielding a Sword of Cleaving +1 and uses the Berserker Knack (+2 damage) would roll the sword's d8 Damage Dice and add 3 to the die of his choice. If the Damage Roll was 5, the hit would do 2 HP of damage, 5+3=8, 8=2 HP.<br>
<br>
If a flat amount of damage is given, then 1 HP of damage is done for each full four points. Caltrops that inflict 1 HP of damage round down to 0 HP.<br>
<br>
When causing damage, reduce monsters <i>Hit Dice</i> instead of Hit Points.<br>
<br>
When taking damage, you may reduce the Body score instead of HP. Any subsequent Body checks use the current score. When Body or HP reach zero, death occurs.
</p>
<p><b>Healing</b><br>
When spending an hour to eat one full ration, uninterrupted (once per day), Heroes recover 1 HP.A full night's rest and a meal will heal the number of HPs  equal to their level. Resting a full night at a safe haven(place with low risk of danger) restores all lost HP. BODY points heal at a rate of 1 per day.<br>
<br>
After every fight or occasion of injury, a hero can take five minutes to bandage their cuts and catch their breath. This first aid will cure up to 2 HP of damage, though it will not heal them above their total before the conflict.<br>
<br>
Healing dice and effects are treated just if they were ‚Äúreversed‚Äù damage dice, healing as many HPs of injury as they would have inflicted points of damage. Thus, a curative potion that the module indicates will heal 1d6+1 damage would be rolled as a ‚Äúreversed‚Äù damage die, curing from 1 to 2 HPs for a hero.<br>
<br>
Monsters and other characters normally heal 1 HD per day of rest.
</p>
<p><b>Gear and Loot</b><br>
Useful gear gives you advantage when performing a task for which the piece of gear was intended. Characters can only benefit from one piece of gear, weapon, or armor per check. Note that in combat it is assumed all are properly armed/armored and this rule would not be applicable.<br>
<b>Armor</b><br>
Shield, 10 gp, AC +1<br>
Helmet	15 gp, AC +1<br>
Leather	20 gp, AC 12<br>
Scale Mail, 30 gp, AC 13<br>

<p><b>Experience</b><br>
A lone hero earns only a quarter of the normal XP for their deeds, reflecting the fact that they have fewer hands to divide the treasure. When a hero gains enough XP, they advance a level and reset their XP to 0. It requires 2000 XP to reach level 2, 3000 to reach level 3, etc.<br>
<br>
When a hero gains a level, roll d8s equal to their new level for their new HPs. If the result is less than their previous maximum, their maximum HP increases by 1. They also raise the scores of 1 ability of their choice by 1 point. Abilities may never be raised higher than 10.</p>

It ends up being that the poor farmers‚Äô trusty scarecrow has been brought to life by dark magic. It is optional to buy or make a new scarecrow.","A PC gets bit by a werewolf. There is a cure for it, however they must convince the mad wizard to give it to you.","A passing man swears to you that he is a genie who will most definitely grant you three wishes if you return his stolen lamp to him.","Every town or settlement the party goes to has an outline of a fish stenciled on a main building. The first one is really big and noticeable; the rest are subtle enough that the party won't see them unless they announce that they're examining the place. The town where the quest will happen has the WORD 'fish' stenciled on a building.","You come across a trail of blood (unicorn) leading to a spooky forest.","The party is followed by an owl, hooting softly, eyes glowing the gentle yellow that might be magic or might be simple reflection. Over the next several days more owls join, until when the group sets down to sleep at night all they can see are hundreds of owl eyes staring down at them. Then, one of the owls scratches a message into the dirt, before flying off into the night- FOLLOW.","An unknown NPC mage has dimension doored into the middle of a fight, after all healing spells have been used by the team. He/She is on death's door and carrying a note with his/hers killers name. He says a few words before dying.","Graffiti is scrawled on the walls of two buildings in town. It appears to be some sort of code. The messages are marked '1' and '3'. Message '2' is nowhere to be found.","A scrap of paper floats on the wind. It glides on the breeze. Eventually in a gust the paper catches on one of the adventures faces. Tearing it off their face, and looking at the parchment they see it is...","Gold! Adventure! Fame! Cries an elf on a soap box, 'the faint of heart need not apply!' (For adventures who need more than obvious plot hooks.)","Looking off to the distance, they can see a flashing light (similar to a signal mirror). Someone is trying to signal far off. Whether it is aide, is indiscernible to the group as the light stops almost as soon as it starts. There is only one way to find out...","While passing by a pond, you hear a deep bellowing noise, only to see a fisherman trapped by a giant frog. He calls for help.","A paladin with the insignia of a lion's head on her shield asks you to solve the local pest problem. Turns out the 'pests' are full sized orcs.","A house outside of town is being circled by hundreds of birds. Upon approaching, the party sees that their beaks are lined with teeth, and the birds are twitching as though trying to escape possession. From the sounds inside, someone is clambering to hide within the building.","Kobolds have been attacking the town. All wearing similar regalia and a matching symbol. a raving man claims to have escaped from the kobolds' lair. He describes a terrible dragon as the source of worship for the kobolds. The dragon is really a pseudodragon with delusions of grandeur, trained in illusion magic and has duped the kobolds into gathering a hoard for him.","In a large city, urchins are a regular problem. This trio of kidlets, however, has been luring travelers in to abandoned alleyways, where the deranged doppelganger among them eats the human and the other two children keep what was it his/her pockets.","A dryad clad in wooden armor leans against a tree his side torn wide open. He hands the party a pouch full of tiny leaves. Taking a pinch and blowing them into the air will lead the party to an ancient temple entrance almost over grown with vines. When close the pouch of leaves crumbles to dust along with the vines covering then entrance of the temple.","You find a small silver coin in the middle of a street and upon picking it up, in your mind you see a small hut deep in the forest. When you come back to reality, only you can see it but a small fae pixie glowing bright blue will show you the way.","The party encounters a man running out from the wood-line, coming towards then. He appears to be in shock over what he has seen, and tells the party that he was attacked while hunting. The man directs the party to the spot were he encounter the creature.","A local temple has reported strange events in the surrounding area: beasts attacking villagers, bandit lords more closer to the village, and mysterious lights and sounds that can only be observed from within the village.","A bounty hunter asks the party if they known any of the names on a list of his. The list contains about 20 names, roll a d20 for the characters knowing any of the names, 1-10 unknown and 11-20 known. The names on the list can be from characters backstory or names of NPCs the party has met throughout the campaign. The bounty hunter will known what each person on the list as done, and how much the reward is for the capture.","A seemingly exorbitant amount of gold is offered on the message board to get rid of a 'house spider'. It turns out that it's about a spider-like mimic in the shape of a house.","The moon stops traveling across the sky, and everyone's time pieces stop working. Word around the continent is a group of warlocks are attempting to gain power from a new patron - the god of Time","More than three people in a given town have all their teeth fall out at the same time.","A nearby civil war is raging, and one of the high ranking officers of one side or the other holes up in a cave. If approached, they will act incredibly defensive. A child is crying somewhere deeper in the cave, and this person refuses to answer any questions about said child.","An allegedly crooked officer of the law is found dead in an alley way and only one person in the whole town seems to care about it at all.","The party is on a faire where a magician is performing tricks with a severed head that can talk. Throughout the show the head blinks in weird patterns. The party talks to the head to find out he is kidnapped and begs for help in finding his body back.","The party comes across an Inn in the middle of nowhere and they decide to stay. They wake up on the ground where the inn used to be and there's no sign of any building ever being there.","Walking through town, the party suddenly gets surrounded by the city guard. A respected captain was murdered. Witnesses say they saw someone looking similar to one of the party members. Upon looking through their things, said member appears to have lost an item easily traced back to him (one half of a pair of gloves/earrings/daggers, family insignia, one of a kind necklace etc.). Sure enough, said item was found at the scene of the crime. Someone is framing them. Not necessarily a doppelganger.","The party stumbles across a dead old man. Amongst his meagre belongings is a thick tome with extensive records about everything they‚Äôve done right up till today, with even more detail than they themselves knew.","The party finds various dead animals with missing pieces, almost torn and shred. As they approach the heart of the forest the number of dead creatures increases. Upon investigation they find out it's the guardian spirit of the forest who has been corrupted and it's confused.","A flyer appears in the sacks of each party member. A mid level demon has opened a store and invites all those with ambitions to visit to make deals.","A rumor reaches the party's ears of a group of brigands hiding out in the woods. They have a code that is the reverse of Robin Hood and his Merry Men: Steal from the poor, and give to the rich. None of the local nobles seem interested in the pillaged goods of their subjects, and are constantly giving back the loot they keep finding on their doorsteps.","The local apothecary is desperate due to the sudden absence of all the local medicinal plants in the area. All the groves and clearings appear to have been picked clean, and even the owner's secret garden is now empty. She had told no one of her hidden garden, and so has no idea who or what could have taken all of the plants in the brief period of time between her most recent check and her previous one.","A human peasant and a member of the fey came across each other in the woods and, over the course of multiple moonlit encounters, fell deeply in love. The peasant's family has a deep-rooted fear of the fey, and is actively trying to put a stop to the pair's relationship. The family is even more fearful that the peasant will leave for the Feywild and never return, and goes to the party to convince them to help break the two lovers up. The human is in love with the Fey's otherworldly allure and sharp wit; talking to them makes the peasant feel alive in a way that they've never felt before. The Fey was originally only interested in the concept of a secretive human lover, but eventually came to love the peasant's dedication to their relationship despite the risk of alienating other loved ones.","While at the market waiting for another adventurer to arrive, you pass the time by idly counting the number of stone gargoyles mounted on the town hall. There are fourteen, all with a silly grin.","While at the blacksmith to repair your armour, you overhear the blacksmith explaining to his apprentice to not stray off to the hills to see his new sweetheart because he heard from the baker's cousin's stepmother that there are kobolds about.","While waiting patiently for your turn to see the Bishop, you get your ear bent by some local shopkeeper about how the town council is a bunch of idiots, and how they simply wasted all that money on getting 13 gargoyle statues erected on the town hall. Thirteen! That's an unlucky number!","A street urchin attempts to filch your purse, he runs off down an alley. The urchin escapes, but in the alley you found a homeless halfling bum. Clearly dead. Looks like he fell from a great height.","The price of that foreign wine you like so much has tripled in price. The barkeep mutters something about pirates. The barkeep explains it's just a euphemism for the wagoneers guild and their extortionate ways.","A dead homeless halfling found in an alley had a small bottle of very cheap whisky. The label has a brand mark you've not seen before - 4 vertical slashes and 2 short slashes across the bottom.","The pommel of a sword you found on your last adventure rattled loose. Inside you a scrap of parchment with lots of scratchmarks, almost looks like writing.","A wanted poster has been nailed up - Wanted: Black Pete, for Brigandry.","The scribe you made inquiries with last week has got back to you. She says the Tomb of Three Chieftains can be found outside Millthorp.","While at market, you saw three wagons being carefully guarded by scruffy and shifty looking mercenaries. There are barrels of cheap rotgut in the wagon.","A pilgrim accosts you in the street. He asks if you'll be travelling east anytime soon.","The bakery has no cake. He explains it's because there's a shortage of milk.","A patrol of the Kings Guard rode fast down main street. They almost ran you over.","There's a parade of pilgrims on main street, heading for the commons. They appear somber and morose.","Southbridge, just outside town, has been closed to traffic due to disrepair. Merchants complain about the 2 hour detour they now incur by first heading east.","The town guard are seen practicing new drills on the common. Apparently a local bandit has enlisted a wizard, and so training in avoiding fireballs is called for.","The local priesthood is paying gold for water collected from the Opal Caves to treat a spreading fever.","An apothecary will pay for certain herbs growing in the Frog Marches.","The local Stonecutters Guild are not petitioning for work contracts; labourers are grumbling.","A frost giant approaches the group. The giant politely asks for help. He lost his pet owlbear and needs help finding it. He promises a very handsome amount of gp as well as 'a powerful ally' if you find the creature.","A goblin in noble clothes crashes through the window and rolls over the ground. The symbol of the king's guard is embroidered on his half-cape. As he gets up, he panics and looks around, fixing his eyes upon the party. 'The Goat-Riders are coming! Please, hide me!'","A large burly man has started a daily ritual of throwing a goat at the side of a local noble's house. He is not damaging the house, so he is not doing anything that will make the local law enforcement arrest him, but the noble wants him dealt with, and will pay you to get rid of him, however.","A sword in the stone can be sensed by all creatures in the land with 'Detect Magic' but lately it seems that the presence is becoming overbearing. Magic users are worried that unless the true king draws the sword, proving his lineage, or the spell 'Detect Magic' will become obsolete.","As the group walks through the forest, one member hears very quiet crying. The crying is coming from a lost juvenile harpy. It is the job of the group to protect this harpy. They can either keep and raise the creature, or return it to its mother.","The party finds a smouldering crater containing a metal wreck. Inside, they find an eccentric kobold who insists she has returned from the moon.","Something appeared or went missing. Something needs to be couriered or retrieved. There is a mystery that relates indirectly to each character.","You all wake up in a cell -- what'd you do last night?"
