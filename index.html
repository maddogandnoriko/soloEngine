<p><b>Create Your Hero</b><br>
   Roll 3d6 once each for <b>BODY</b> (physical prowess & health), <b>AGILE</b> (reflexes & quickness), <b>MIND</b> (mental capacity & intelligence), <b>SPIRIT</b> (spunk & willpower). The lowest of the three dice is that ability‚Äôs score. For Hit Points roll 1d8. Heroes begin with one clich√©, roll 2d6, and gain one clich√© for each roll over 3. If you wish, determine a past, looks, quirks, etc. Be creative and stuff. Heroes start with a light weapon(d6 damage) and leather armor(AC 12).</p>
<p><b>Determine Goals & The First Scene</b><br>
  Figure out why your character is there and where they are in their story. This is a short description of where our hero is and what's happening. Imagine a starting point for your adventure. <i>Are you stealing space station plans? Are you plundering a tomb?</i></p>
<p><b>Advantage & Disadvantage</b><br>
            When you roll dice and the hero has an applicable clich√©, advantage, trait etc., roll an extra die and pick the best result. If the character has a significant disadvantage,  pick the worst result. This applies to almost ALL rolls, including combat and ability checks. Characters can only gain 1 extra die per roll.</p>
<p><b>Begin Asking Questions</b><br>
            To begin play, ask a question that has a <b>Yes</b>‚Äã or <b>No</b> answer, it is important to keep it simple. <i>Are guards present? Do I encounter a trap?</i> For each question, if the result is <i>Even Odds</i> roll 1d6, if the result is <i>Likely</i> or <i>Unlikely</i> roll 2d6, if the result is <i>Very Likely</i> or <i>Very Unlikely</i> roll 3d6 and choose the best/worst result as appropriate and consult the table below.<br>
            1- No, And&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4-Yes, But<br>
            2- No&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5-Yes<br>
            3- No, But&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6-Yes, And<br>
            <br>
            <b><i>"And"</i></b> means even better/worse than you expected.<br>
            <b><i>"But"</i></b> means there is a limited effect or a drawback.</p>
<p><b>Twist</b><br>
            Roll a d6. This is the Twist Die. If it comes up a 1, there is a twist to the scene.<br>
            <br>
            Roll a d6 to get the Twist Noun:<br>
            1- NPC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2- PC<br>
            3- Organization&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4- Physical event<br>
            5- Emotional event&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6- Item<br>
            <br>
            Roll another d6 to get the Twist Action:<br>
            1- Appears&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2- Alters the location<br>
            3- Helps the hero&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4- Hinders the hero<br>
            5- Changes the goal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6- Ends the scene<br>
            <br>
            Put the Twist Noun and Twist Action together to get a two-word sentence. What this means is up to you based on the goings on.</p>
<p><b>Ability Checks</b><br>
If a character attempts something where the outcome is uncertain and failure is possible, they make an Ability Check(Check).<br>
<br>
Roll a d20 and add the relevant ability score. If the total is greater than 15, the character succeeds. If not, they fail.</p>
<p><b>Opposed Checks</b><br>
If a Check is opposed by another character, then instead of aiming to exceed 15, you must exceed the opposing character‚Äôs relevant ability score +10 in order to succeed.</p>
<p><b>Resolving Combat</b><br>
To make an attack, roll a d20 and add the character‚Äôs <b>BODY</b>(melee) or <b>MIND</b>(ranged) score. If the Attack Roll total is greater than the defender‚Äôs Armor Class, the attack hits. If not, the attack misses. <i>Monsters usually don't have ability scores, add their HD to rolls instead.</i></p>
<p>
  <b>Taking & Causing Damage</b><br>
ALL Damage Rolls (traps, monsters, falling debris, random injuries, etc.) are modified. If a Damage Roll includes more than one die, do not add them together, modify each die face, then add them.<br>
<br>
<b>Roll&nbsp;Damage</b><br>
1	0 HP<br>
2-5	1 HP<br>
6-9	2 HP<br>
10+	4 HP<br>
<br>
Any modifiers to damage are all applied to any one die in the Damage Roll. Example A PC wielding a Sword of Cleaving +1 and uses the Berserker Knack (+2 damage) would roll the sword's d8 Damage Dice and add 3 to the die of his choice. If the Damage Roll was 5, the hit would do 2 HP of damage, 5+3=8, 8=2 HP.<br>
<br>
If a flat amount of damage is given, then 1 HP of damage is done for each full four points. Caltrops that inflict 1 HP of damage round down to 0 HP.<br>
<br>
When causing damage, reduce monsters <i>Hit Dice</i> instead of Hit Points.<br>
<br>
When taking damage, you may reduce the Body score instead of HP. Any subsequent Body checks use the current score. When Body or HP reach zero, death occurs.
</p>
<p><b>Healing</b><br>
When spending an hour to eat one full ration, uninterrupted (once per day), Heroes recover 1 HP.A full night's rest and a meal will heal the number of HPs  equal to their level. Resting a full night at a safe haven(place with low risk of danger) restores all lost HP. BODY points heal at a rate of 1 per day.<br>
<br>
After every fight or occasion of injury, a hero can take five minutes to bandage their cuts and catch their breath. This first aid will cure up to 2 HP of damage, though it will not heal them above their total before the conflict.<br>
<br>
Healing dice and effects are treated just if they were ‚Äúreversed‚Äù damage dice, healing as many HPs of injury as they would have inflicted points of damage. Thus, a curative potion that the module indicates will heal 1d6+1 damage would be rolled as a ‚Äúreversed‚Äù damage die, curing from 1 to 2 HPs for a hero.<br>
<br>
Monsters and other characters normally heal 1 HD per day of rest.
</p>
<p><b>Gear and Loot</b><br>
Useful gear gives you advantage when performing a task for which the piece of gear was intended. Characters can only benefit from one piece of gear, weapon, or armor per check. Note that in combat it is assumed all are properly armed/armored and this rule would not be applicable.<br>
<b>Armor</b><br>
Shield, 10 gp, AC +1<br>
Helmet	15 gp, AC +1<br>
Leather	20 gp, AC 12<br>
Scale Mail, 30 gp, AC 13<br>

<p><b>Experience</b><br>
A lone hero earns only a quarter of the normal XP for their deeds, reflecting the fact that they have fewer hands to divide the treasure. When a hero gains enough XP, they advance a level and reset their XP to 0. It requires 2000 XP to reach level 2, 3000 to reach level 3, etc.<br>
<br>
When a hero gains a level, roll d8s equal to their new level for their new HPs. If the result is less than their previous maximum, their maximum HP increases by 1. They also raise the scores of 1 ability of their choice by 1 point. Abilities may never be raised higher than 10.</p>
